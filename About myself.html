					My name is Ogunleye Kolade. I am live in Ogbomoso, Oyo State. I am from Iresa-Adu.I am the second born child among four boys. My Parents name- <b>Dr. Mrs Kayode Ronke Ogunleye</b>. I was given birth to on 1st of January, 2002 in Baptist Teaching Hospital.	My primary school education is from <b>NBTS Staff School, Ogbomoso</b>. Graduated in 2012 and went to Secondary school in Ilorin. <b>Total Child Secondary School</b>. A place that didnt feel like home before but later turned out to be a nice home. It's a place that brought up most of the changes in my life. I finished there in 2018. Then, I moved up the ladder,now in a school in Minna. <b>Federal University of Technology, Minna</b>. It is  Federal University,so progressing up the level is slow. I study Mechatronics Engineering.

					My hobbies are very few. They are, Reading novels, Playing Games and Watching movies. What I always had passion for since when I was young is Mathematics. It's always been my best subject. I also have interests in the aspects of computers, soft ware and hardware also, that's one of the reasons i went for Mechatronics as a course to study and is why I'm here in SQI also. This is a place I'd like to learn a lot from and to be able to finish well.
